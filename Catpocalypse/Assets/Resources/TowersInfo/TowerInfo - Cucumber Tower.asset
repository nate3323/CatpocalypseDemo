  Description: 'The standard tower, it launches cucumbers to scare the more cowardly
    cats while the braver cats play with them! Each launched cucumber can somewhat
    distract a single cat.


    Science can never tell why cats got bamboozled by
    cucumbers, but since they are, launching cucumbers at them will surely distract
    them from everything!'
