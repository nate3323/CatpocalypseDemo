  Description: 'The string waver tower makes a ball of yarn and waves it in an hypnotic
    pattern, causing distraction per second to nearby cats while it''s waving the
    ball.


    A cat can watch a granny weave for hours. We don''t have any granny
    towers, but this string weaver would do just fine to distract nearby felines!'
